#keep_alives:
    # this is a very optional thing but can be useful. It will monitor a
    # specific topic to determine if a device should be on or off. The
    # amount of time it has been since it received something in the subscribe
    # topic is the trigger for turning the location on/off. A usage example
    # is available here:    https://github.com/flavio-fernandes/imalive
#    toaster: # the location affected by this keep-alive
#        interval: 10  # how often to send a ping, in seconds
#        timeout: 60   # how long w/out a 'pong' to turn off device
#        publish_topic: /toaster/ping  # set this to '' if a ping is not needed
#        subscribe_topic: /toaster/pong
